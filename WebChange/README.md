# WebChange.py

This is a little script to watch for changes in a web page.  Nice to 
use if you are waiting for something to come back in stock, though be 
forewarned that most "modern" shopping sites inject a lot of crap into 
the page every time it is loaded, and that will be seen as a change.

This script is not my creation, but is merely a slight modification to 
use Python 3 and is based entirely on the script provided by 
[Hunter Thornsberry](http://www.adventuresintechland.com).  All 
credit goes to him.
